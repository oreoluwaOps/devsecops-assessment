# DevSecOps Implementation Guide

This guide provides detailed technical implementation details for the Senior DevSecOps Lead Technical Assessment solution.

## Part 1: Infrastructure Design & Architecture

### Cloud Infrastructure Design

#### Network Architecture
The infrastructure implements a three-tier network architecture across multiple availability zones:

**Public Tier**: Internet Gateway and NAT Gateways for controlled internet access with Application Load Balancer for ingress traffic distribution.

**Private Tier**: EKS worker nodes and application workloads with no direct internet access, communicating through NAT gateways for outbound traffic.

**Data Tier**: RDS instances in isolated subnets with encryption at rest and in transit, accessible only from application tier with security group restrictions.

#### Compute Strategy
**EKS Cluster Configuration**:
- Managed node groups with mixed instance types (m5.large, m5.xlarge)
- Cluster Autoscaler for automatic scaling based on pod requirements
- Spot instances for cost optimization on non-critical workloads
- Pod Security Standards enforcement for container security

**Scaling Policies**:
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler based on CPU and memory metrics
- Vertical Pod Autoscaler for resource optimization
- Cluster Autoscaler for node-level scaling decisions

#### Data Management
**Database Design**:
- Multi-AZ RDS deployment with automated failover
- Read replicas for performance optimization
- Point-in-time recovery with 35-day retention
- Encryption using AWS KMS with customer-managed keys

**Backup Strategy**:
- Automated daily snapshots with cross-region replication
- Application-level backups for microservices data
- Disaster recovery procedures with RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour

### Security Architecture

#### Defense-in-Depth Implementation
**Network Security**:
- VPC with private subnets and controlled egress
- Security groups with least-privilege access rules
- Network ACLs for additional subnet-level protection
- VPC endpoints for secure AWS service communication

**Container Security**:
- Pod Security Standards with restricted profile
- Network policies for inter-pod communication control
- Admission controllers for policy enforcement
- Container image scanning and vulnerability management

**Application Security**:
- AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data management
- IAM roles with least-privilege permissions
- Service mesh for mTLS communication
- Application-level authentication and authorization

#### Compliance Framework
**NIST Cybersecurity Framework Alignment**:
- Identify: Asset inventory and risk assessment procedures
- Protect: Access controls and data protection measures
- Detect: Continuous monitoring and anomaly detection
- Respond: Incident response procedures and automation
- Recover: Backup and disaster recovery capabilities

## Part 2: DevSecOps Pipeline Implementation

### Pipeline Architecture

#### Security-First Design
The CI/CD pipeline implements shift-left security principles with integrated security validation at every stage:

**Pull Request Phase**:
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with SonarQube
- Dependency vulnerability scanning with OWASP Dependency Check
- Code quality analysis with quality gate enforcement
- Unit and integration testing with coverage requirements

**Build Phase**:
- Secure container image building with multi-stage Dockerfiles
- Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Image signing for supply chain security
- Secure registry storage with access controls

**Deployment Phase**:
- Infrastructure security validation
- Runtime security policy enforcement
- Health checks and automated rollback
- Security compliance reporting

#### Automation Strategy
**Continuous Integration**:
```yaml
Security Scan → Build → Container Scan → Deploy
```

**Branch Strategy**:
- `develop` branch: Automated deployment to development environment
- `main` branch: Automated deployment to production with approval gates
- `hotfix/*` branches: Emergency deployment pipeline with fast-track security validation

#### Container Security Implementation
**Multi-stage Docker Builds**:
- Separate build and runtime environments
- Minimal base images (distroless) for reduced attack surface
- Non-root user execution for enhanced security
- Dependency caching for build performance

**Image Security**:
- Regular base image updates through automated scanning
- Vulnerability database synchronization
- SARIF reporting integration with GitHub Security
- Policy-based deployment gates based on vulnerability severity

### Security Tool Integration

#### Static Application Security Testing
**SonarQube Configuration**:

- Automatic security hotspot detection
- Integration with GitHub pull request workflows

**Security Metrics**:
- Code coverage requirements (minimum 80%)
- Security rating thresholds (A-grade requirement)
- Technical debt tracking and remediation
- Vulnerability trend analysis

#### Dependency Management
**OWASP Dependency Check**:
- CVSS scoring with configurable thresholds
- National Vulnerability Database (NVD) integration
- Suppression file for false positives
- Automated dependency update recommendations

**Supply Chain Security**:
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation
- License compliance checking
- Dependency source verification
- Automated security advisory monitoring

### Infrastructure as Code

#### Terraform Implementation
**Modular Design**:
- Separate modules for networking, compute, database, and monitoring
- Environment-specific variable files
- State management with remote backend
- Plan validation and security scanning

**Security Hardening**:
- Checkov integration for infrastructure security scanning
- Terraform Cloud for secure plan execution
- Drift detection and remediation procedures
- Resource tagging for cost allocation and security tracking

#### Kubernetes Manifests
**Helm Chart Structure**:
- Templated deployments with environment-specific values
- Security contexts and resource limits
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Service mesh integration configurations

**Security Policies**:
- Pod Security Standards enforcement
- Network policies for traffic segmentation
- Resource quotas and limit ranges
- Admission controller configurations

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Comprehensive Monitoring Stack
**Prometheus Configuration**:
- Application metrics collection with custom exporters
- Infrastructure metrics from node-exporter and kube-state-metrics
- Alert manager for multi-channel notifications
- Long-term storage with Thanos

**Grafana Dashboards**:
- Application performance monitoring
- Infrastructure health and capacity planning
- Security metrics and compliance tracking
- Business metrics and SLA monitoring

**Logging Strategy**:
- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Log retention policies and compliance
- Security event aggregation and analysis

#### Alerting Framework
**Multi-tier Alerting**:
- Critical alerts to PagerDuty for immediate response
- Warning alerts to Slack for team awareness
- Information alerts to email for audit trails
- Escalation procedures for unacknowledged alerts
