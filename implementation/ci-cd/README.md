# DevSecOps CI/CD Implementation

This implementation provides a production-ready DevSecOps pipeline with integrated security scanning, automated deployment, and comprehensive observability for microservices architecture.

## Pipeline Architecture

### Security-First Design
The pipeline implements shift-left security with three core stages:

1. **Security & Quality Validation** - SAST analysis, dependency scanning, and comprehensive testing
2. **Container Security** - Multi-platform builds with vulnerability scanning and secure registry storage  
3. **Automated Deployment** - Helm-based Kubernetes deployment with health validation and rollback capabilities

```

## Security Integration

### Comprehensive Scanning
**SAST Analysis**: SonarQube integration with quality gates preventing insecure code deployment.

**Dependency Security**: OWASP Dependency Check with CVSS scoring and automated vulnerability monitoring.

**Container Security**: Trivy scanning with SARIF reporting to GitHub Security tab for centralized vulnerability management.

### Deployment Security
**Immutable Artifacts**: Commit-based image tagging ensuring deployment traceability and preventing tag manipulation.

**Environment Isolation**: Separate deployment pipelines for development and production with appropriate security controls.

**Secrets Management**: Integration with AWS Secrets Manager and secure environment variable handling.

## Pipeline Features

### Automated Workflows
- **Pull Request Validation**: Comprehensive security and quality checks before code integration
- **Branch-based Deployment**: Automatic deployment to development (develop branch) and production (main branch)
- **Emergency Response**: Dedicated hotfix pipeline with expedited security validation

### Observability
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Complete pipeline visibility with detailed logging and artifact management
- **Security Reporting**: SARIF integration for centralized vulnerability tracking
- **Slack Notifications**: Real-time deployment status and security alert delivery

## Configuration

### Required Secrets
Configure these secrets in GitHub repository settings:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` - AWS infrastructure access
- `EKS_CLUSTER_NAME_DEVELOPMENT`, `EKS_CLUSTER_NAME_PRODUCTION` - Kubernetes cluster identifiers
- `SONAR_TOKEN` - SonarQube authentication for SAST analysis
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK` - Notification delivery endpoint

### Registry Configuration
The pipeline supports configurable container registries through repository variables:
- `REGISTRY_URL` (default: ghcr.io) - Container registry endpoint
- `REGISTRY_NAMESPACE` (default: github.repository) - Registry organization/namespace

## Usage

### Standard Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to development environment
./scripts/deploy.sh development

# Deploy to production environment
./scripts/deploy.sh production

# Validate deployment health
./scripts/health-check.sh production
```

### Emergency Procedures
Create hotfix branches for critical security issues:
```bash
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix
# Implement fixes
git push origin hotfix/critical-security-fix
```

## Security Standards Compliance

This implementation adheres to industry security standards:
- **OWASP DevSecOps Guidelines** for secure development lifecycle integration
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** for comprehensive security controls
- **Cloud Native Security Patterns** for container and Kubernetes security
- **GitHub Actions Security Best Practices** for CI/CD security

The pipeline provides enterprise-grade security validation while maintaining development velocity through automation and comprehensive monitoring.
